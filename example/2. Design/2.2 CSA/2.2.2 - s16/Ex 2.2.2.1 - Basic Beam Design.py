This example shows how a simply supported W steel element can be checked for 
moment when the beam is laterally supported, or unsupported.  
A 6m long beam is analyzed with two point loads as shown bellow. 
A plot of the beam analyzed is output as part of this example. 
The beam is assessed in three conditions: 
    continuous lateral support is provided to the beam, 
    the beam is unsupported and loaded on it's top flange, and 
    the loaded at it's shear center.

The capacity of the section is determined by limitstates, and compared

First the base limitstates library is imported, then s16 steel design library.
